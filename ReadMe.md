# Flight Options Excercise

Supplied:

1. `flight-options.json`: A JSON array of return flights between Brisbane and Fiji.
2. `carriers.json`: A JSON array of carriers that can be used to map names from carrier identifiers.
3. `flight-options-shape.ts`: TypeScript interfaces that describe the shape and contents of the data provided in flight-options.json.
4. `FlightOptionsMockup.png`: A static mockup of how to display the flight options.

Required:

Your job is to build a UI that closely matches `FlightOptionsMockup.png` and uses the data provided in both `flight-options.json` and `carriers.json`.

It should be written in TypeScript (ES6/7 acceptable as well) and should utilise either KnockoutJS or React to demonstrate your familiarity with either of those libraries.

Feel free to use any other open-source libraries that will help achieve the desired result. (LoDash/Underscore, Moment, Bootstrap etc.)
